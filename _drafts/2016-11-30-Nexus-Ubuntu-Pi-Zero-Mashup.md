I recently viewed a youtube video from the NODE channel where they built a small portable laptop type device, running Ubuntu.
It got me thinking, maybe I too could re-purpose my Nexus 7. Then I read a post from a link on Hacker News where Pi Zeros where used
to build a OTG Docker swarm network. I sat for a while and decided, you know what would be cool? Mixing these two projects together to build a
a portable machine with the capability to manage a docker swarm network and distributed computing. Why? Curiosity mostly. So here it is a Nexus 7, Ubuntu, Pi Zero Mash-up.
