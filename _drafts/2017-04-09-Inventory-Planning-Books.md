I recently decided to have a look through Amazon for second hand books on the topic of Production planning and Control Systems. <!--more --> Generally, I am interested in how the the topic developed and informed the fields of operations management, operations research and supply chain management. I also just wanted to build up a collection of reference books, that are seminal works. Many of them have algorithms and models in that are either still in use or were extended in subsequent literature. I hope reading through them will inform my thinking for the supplychainpy library and any related systems I build in the future. So far I have purchased:

- Buffa, E.S. and Taubert, W.H., 1972. Production-inventory systems: planning and control.

- Wagner, H.M. 1971. Principles of operations research: With applications to managerial decisons. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1969. 937 pp.

The book by Buffa and Taubert
