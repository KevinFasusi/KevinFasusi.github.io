<p>For the longest time I have been wracked with fear about sharing. It has made writing blogs for instance, impossible because I am always waiting for enough time to write something <!--more -->I hope will not be met with derision and mocked. I think this is partly to do with imposter syndrome and partly to do with my upbringing. I then get frustrated because I am doing several things that I would like to share, not becasue I think they are noteworthy but just because these are the things that interest me and I think that they might interest others.</p>

<p>Regarding my fear about what I write being mocked, I have also decided to get over myself because:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I am pretty sure no one cares.</li>
  <li>see above.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have temporarily satiated my imposter syndrome by applying for and receiving a place on an MSc Computer Science course at Birkbeck University of London, after taking an entrance exam. So just when I thought I was out, I put my hand back in the game. Not too long ago I had my Viva Voce and received a pass with minor corrections. Currently, I am finishing the corrections to my PhD thesis (operations and supply chain management) and also trying to piece together a few papers.</p>
