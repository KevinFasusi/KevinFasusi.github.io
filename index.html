<p>Hi my name is Kevin, I initially studied Accounting as an undergrad then followed it up with a MSc in Logistics and Supply Chain Management. In my first job roles I found myself doing several repetitive tasks, dealing with multiple data sources and data feeds. Reporting, analysing and operating day to day became problematic. Sometimes poorly implemented ERP/MRP systems or divergent business practices rendered existing systems incompitent at what should arguably be their core function. Automating tasks, centralising data and developing analytical line of business tools quickly became a part of my skillset. </p>

<p>To centralise data for an analystical backend, I found myself learning and using T-SQL, SSIS, SSRS and PL\SQL for development and administration. For automation and analysis, I started with VBA, VBScript and later PowerShell. These were the tools readily available at the time. However as my compitence grew and the problem domains got larger, these tools had some limitation. Coding dll's in .net extended functionality but is not a pancea.</p>

<p>Whilst the domain specific knowledge came first, it was not long before my passion for the technical aspects of solving problems became my focus both at work and in my spare time. I pursed jobs within Supply Chain and Logistics, as I enjoys the domain but specifically developer roles. Currently at work I use Visual Studio and .net for both desktop and web applications but I love me some FOSS.<p>

<p>I have been using Linux for personal use, for as long as I can remember. Learing Python and bash away from work. The FOSS community is very active and always doing amazing things and I test and try to find a project to use the awesome tools and laguages, although it is almost impossible to keep up but that is part of the fun. I have use Yeoman and vagrant, I like Sublime but use Vim religiously when working in C. I am currently workin on an embedded systems application in C and using Yocto project for my linux build on a beaglebone black platform.</p>

<p>I have been lucky enough to work with several technologies whilst focusing on Supply Chain specific problems and Im currently working with WPF, XAML, Vb.net and MS Sql server. Our team is rationalising our line of business applications and data sources.<p>

<p>Solving real world problems, for which I have a vested interest in the outcome, has allowed me to explore the more technically demanding aspects of software engineering. I treat this as a craft, I am hungry to learn more and code everyday. I just want to be better and keep enjoying what I do.</p>

<p>While the majority of my work is for my employers, and therefore behind a firewall, I do try to find time for my own projects. In addition to the emebedded systems hobby project, I am currently working on a naive bayes document classifier as part of my PhD. The project is hosted on github: <a href="https://github.com/KevinFasusi/NaiveBayesDocumentClassifier">NaiveBayesClassifier</a></p>
