<p>Hi, my name is Kevin. I initially studied Accounting as an undergrad then followed it up with an MSc in Logistics and Supply Chain Management. In my first job roles, I found myself doing several repetitive tasks, dealing with multiple data sources and data feeds. Reporting, analysing and operating day to day became problematic. Sometimes poorly implemented ERP/MRP systems or divergent business practices rendered existing systems incompetent at what should arguably be their core function. Automating tasks, centralising data and developing an analytical line of business tools quickly became a part of my skillset. </p>

<p>To centralise data for an analytical backend, I found myself learning and using T-SQL, SSIS, SSRS and PL\SQL for development and administration. For automation and analysis, I started with VBA, VBScript and later PowerShell.</p>

<p>While the  specific domain knowledge came first, it was not long before my passion for the technical aspects of solving problems became my focus both at work and in my spare time. I pursued jobs within Supply Chain and Logistics, as I enjoy the domain but specifically developer roles. Currently at work I use Visual Studio and .net for both desktop and web applications but I love me some FOSS.<p>

<p>I have been using Linux for personal use, for as long as I can remember. The open source community is very active and always doing amazing things. I test and try to use some of the awesome tools and languages, although it is almost impossible to keep up, but that is part of the fun.</p>

<p>At work I use Visual Studio, however I like Sublime and prefer to use Vim. I am currently working on an embedded systems application in C, in my free time, using Yocto project for my Linux build for a BeagleBone black.</p>

<p>I have been lucky enough to work with several technologies wwhile focusing on Supply Chain specific problems. I am currently working with WPF, XAML, Vb.net and MS SQL server. Our team is currently rationalising our line of business applications and data sources, after a major organisation reshuffle.<p>

<p>Solving real world problems that I have a vested interest in the outcome, beyond the timely and efficient submission of code, has allowed me to explore solutions and pick the best tools for the job; I treat this as a craft. I am hungry to learn more and write code every day. I just want to be better and keep enjoying what I do.</p>

<p>While the majority of my work is for my employers, and therefore behind a firewall, I do try to find time for my projects. I am also currently working on a Naive Bayes document classifier as part of my Ph.D. The project hosted on github: <a href="https://github.com/KevinFasusi/NaiveBayesDocumentClassifier">NaiveBayesClassifier</a></p>
