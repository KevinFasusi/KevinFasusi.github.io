<p>Hi my name is Kevin, I originally studied Accounting as an undergrad then followed it up with a MSc in Logistics and Supply Chain Management. In my first job roles I found myself doing several repetitive tasks, dealing with multiple data sources and data feeds. Reporting, analysing and operating day to day became problematic. Sometimes poorly implemented ERP/MRP systems or divergent business practices rendered existing systems incompitent at what should arguably be their core function. Automating tasks, centralising data and developing analytical line of business tools quickly became a part of my skillset. 

<p>To centralise data for an analystical backend, I found myself learning and using T-SQL and PL\SQL for development and administration. For automation and analysis, I started with VBA, VBScript and later PowerShell. These were the tools readily available at the time. However as my compitence grew and the problem domains got larger, these tools had some limitation. Coding dll's in .net extended functionality but is not a pancea. </p>

<p>Whilst the domain specific knowledge came first, it was not long before my passion for the technical aspects of solving problems became my focus both at work and in my spare time. I pursed jobs within Supply Chain and Logistics, as I enjoys the domain but specifically developer roles. Currently at work I use Visual Studio and .net for both desktop and web applications but I love me some FOSS. I secretly wish for the day, when working behind the firewall is not a thing and I can develop on some of the brilliant PaaS.<p>

<p>I have been using Linux for personal use, for as long as I can remember. Learing Python and bash away from work. The FOSS community is very active and always doing amazing things and I test and try to find a project to use the awesome tools and laguages, although it is almost impossible to keep up but that is part of the fun. From Yeoman to Nancy, Puppet to Chef, Sublime to hardcore Vim. I have used several and my favorites. I have provided a link to some of these projects.

<p>I have been lucky enough to work with several technologies whilst focusing on Supply Chain specific problems and Im currently moving towards C++ projects. I think that having real world problems to solve, has allowed me to explore the more technically demanding aspects of programming by abstracting real world problems, for which I have a vested interest in the outcome. I treat this as a craft, I am hungry to learn more and code everyday. I just want to be better and keep enjoying what I do.</p>

<p>Business Intelligence, Requirements Analysis etc.</p>

<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
