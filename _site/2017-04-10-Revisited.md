## Innovations

I will explore each item form the matrix in more detail and identify any current or future technology innovations that may have an impact in mitigating against the risk and where possible identify the companies persuing the solutions or highlight the market oppurtunity and gap. 

### Natural Disaster

### Supplier relat

### Licensing

Software licensing and contractual service level agreements (SLAs) are increasingly the popular revenue stream for enterprise software. Open source software has been gathering steam, with even Microsoft conceding to the trend and offering several of their core products as open source software and developing brand new tools (vscode) specifically for the community. This space however is not without it's dragons. Recently SAP have taken a very well known beverage fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, Diageo,  to court for alledgedly abusing their SAP license. The heart of the dispute is the use of SAP's proprietary platform to build a client facing portal (link).

While the legality of the situation is not one I can debate there does seem to be an oppurtunity here that others may seek to take advantage of. Extensible ERP /MRP systems are very much what the doctor ordered. SAP may be doing what the music industry and the publising industry did when faced with the illigal reproduction and distribution of copyright material. They refused to acknowledge the oppurtunity in the hopes that they could litigate the problem away. The pervasiveness of APIs shows no signs of abating. If anything the fact that you can now montise your api on platforms like Azure and AWS makes me think this trend will continue. From my time as a line of business (LOB) application developer, there is an insatiable appetitie for these frankenstein mockups and piggybacking off enterprise platforms should be expected.

Companies such as Odoo, Tryton, ERP5 and Llyamasoft afford there userbase some extensibility. 


## impact stuff cut short
For example a, small manufacturer's access to finance may be a mitigating factor in the types of contract they can enter into with a larger organisation. In situations where having cash (liquidity) is necessary for the supplier to purchase the materials for the production run.  Services like supply chain finance (reverse factoring) can become a major consideration. How to support this within a SaaS model, for example, would be an attractive proposition.
