        <p>Supply chain management is more than just inventory management with trucks and sheds. <!--more --> The term subsumes man. As such the remit of the subject is quite broad. Managing a supply chain invariably means managing various processes, operations and systems, all of which have associated risks. Some of these risks have different probabilities of occuring and if they occur, their impact on the supply chain and operation can vary greatly.</p>

<p>For instance, inventory shortages or excess have a relatively high probability of occuring in most operations. Poor forecasting can cause this predicament but so too can the mismanagement of new product introduction (NPI) or the mismanagement of end of life (EOL) run down of stock. Arguably, inventory shortages or excess have a low impact on an operation in comparison to say a natural disaster that cuts off supply of a required resource.</p>

<p>It has been helpful for me to make an impact assessment that takes into account probability of occuring when examining what features and products to work on now and future products or projects. Below is a table outlining the assessment:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2"><strong>Impact
    <td style="text-align:center;" colspan="2"> <strong>Probability </strong></td>
  
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center;"><strong>Low</strong></td>
    <td><strong>High</strong></td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td><strong>High</strong></td>
    <td>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Natural Disaster</li>
    		<li>Multi Port Closure</li>
    		<li>Contamination</li>
    		<li>Scandal (e.g. slave labour)</li>
    		<li>Production and orderfulfilment mis-match</li>
    		<li>Supplier Bankrupcy</li>
    		<li>Incorrect Liscensing</li>
    
    	</ul>
    </td>
    <td>    
    	<ul>
    		<li>Poor New Product Introduction</li>
    		<li>Poor end of life planning</li>
    		<li>Wrong supplier relationship (e.g. contratual SLA)</li>
    		<li>Scandal (e.g. slave labour)</li>
    		<li>Duties and Taxes</li>
    		<li>Data inaccuracy</li>   
    		<li>Skills Gap</li>
    		<li>Rising Nationalism</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
    	</ul>
    </td>

     <tr>
    <td><strong>Low</strong></td>
    <td>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Shrinkage (theft)</li>
    		<li>Obsolesence</li>
    
    <td>
    <ul>
    	<li> Inventory (Excess/Shortage) </li>
		<li> Transportation Disruption </li>
		<li> Single Port Closure </li>
</ul>

The location of items in this matrix may vary depending on the size of the organisation, their industry and their position within their network of suppliers. For a small manufacturer access to finance may be a mitigating factor on the types of contract they can enter into with a larger organisation. In situations where having cash (liquidity) is necessary for the supplier to purchase the materials for the production run, practices like supply chain finance (reverse factoring) become an important consideration. How to support this within a SaaS model for example would be an interesting proposition.

## Innovations

I will explore each item form the matrix in more detail and identify any current or future technology innovations that may have an impact in mitigating against the risk and where possible identify the companies persuing the solutions or highlight the market oppurtunity and gap. 

### Natural Disaster

(use academic articles, websites and magazine articles share on twitter and linkedin)

### Supplier relat

### Licensing

Software licensing and contractual service level agreements (SLAs) are increasingly the popular revenue stream for enterprise software. Open source software has been gathering steam, with even Microsoft conceding to the trend and offering several of their core products as open source software and developing brand new tools (vscode) specifically for the community. This space however is not without it's dragons. Recently SAP have taken a very well known beverage fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, Diageo,  to court for alledgedly abusing their SAP license. The heart of the dispute is the use of SAP's proprietary platform to build a client facing portal (link).

While the legality of the situation is not one I can debate there does seem to be an oppurtunity here that others may seek to take advantage of. Extensible ERP /MRP systems are very much what the doctor ordered. SAP may be doing what the music industry and the publising industry did when faced with the illigal reproduction and distribution of copyright material. They refused to acknowledge the oppurtunity in the hopes that they could litigate the problem away. The pervasiveness of APIs shows no signs of abating. If anything the fact that you can now montise your api on platforms like Azure and AWS makes me think this trend will continue. From my time as a line of business (LOB) application developer, there is an insatiable appetitie for these frankenstein mockups and piggybacking off enterprise platforms should be expected.

Companies such as Odoo, Tryton, ERP5 and Llyamasoft afford there userbase some extensibility.
