<p>The benefits of blockchain for supply chain management, is a hot topic. I won’t lie, I briefly wondered how I could fit blockchain into supplychainpy. Thankfully, I have my hands full implementing and refactoring the bread and butter of the library.<!--more --> I am still curious about it’s possible application.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-blockchain">What is the blockchain?</h2>
<p>The blockchain is an open distributed ledger. Peer-to-peer database maintains meticulous transaction records autonomously. The technology is a core component of bitcoin the digital currency.</p>

<p>There seems to be a gold rush in supply chain management centered around new technologies. Blockchain is definitely a technology many startups and established companies are focusing on.</p>

<p>I don’t know that much about the blockchain but I hope to play with some of the python tools being developed when I get a chance. It seems to me that blockchain is the atomic digital representation of analog processes, transactions and interactions. Realtime translation of analog to digital in supply chains, has always been hard. Deriving insight from the process, has been even harder. RFIDs, telematics and a standardised enterprise data interchange language (EDI) were once touted as the solution and now so too is blockchain. Maybe a mix of these technologies will give rise to a solution. 
Warehousing, trunking and break bulk activities, may be the first benificiaries. Having a realtime ledger that reconciles every inventory movement across all warehouses in a big operation would be a big win. But I doubt one technology is going to get us there. It will as always be the implementation details for a system using several technologies, that be the killer application of blockchain.</p>
